## Crab Stack

2-4 Player 30 Minutes

### Objective

To be the last player who still has a crab that can be legally moved.

### Setup

To begin the game every player chooses a color of crab that they would like to use in the game. All of the crabs of the colors chosen are mixed up and are randomly placed on the game board. Each player has 9 crabs (3 smalls, 3 mediums and 3 largers). Based on the number of players, only a portion of the game board may be used:

* Two players: yellow rocks
* Three players: yellow and black rocks
* Four players: all rocks

### Moving Crabs

During their turn each player moves one of their crabs. Each type of crab must move a different number of spaces based on their size.

* Small crabs: 3 spaces
* Medium crabs: 2 spaces
* Large crabs: 1 space

Crabs must move all of the spaces associated with their size. For example a small crab will have to move all three spaces and can’t stop after moving one or two spaces. Crabs can only move across other crabs and cannot move across or onto vacant rocks or through the water. A crab may not move back onto a space they were already on during this turn. Crabs must always end their turn on top of another crab. When crabs are part of a stack, only the top crab on any stack is allowed to move. If a top crab moves, the new top crab on the stack is allowed to move once again. Stacking crabs must follow certain rules so any movement that would break the following rules is not allowed.

* Large crabs can be stacked on top of any other crab including other large crabs.
* Medium crabs can be stacked on top of other medium or small crabs.
* Small crabs can only be stacked on top of other small crabs.

### The Wave Rule

Crabs like to stay in a large group and don’t like to separate. In situations where the crabs are separated into two groups, a wave will hit the crabs and some of the crabs will be removed from the game. The players figure out which group of crabs cover up more spaces on the game board. All of the crabs from the group that takes up less spaces on the game board are removed from the game. For example there is one group of crabs that take up ten spaces on the game board while the other group takes up eight spaces. The group that fill eight spaces will be eliminated from the game.

If both groups of crabs take up the same number of spaces on the game board, the players count how many crabs are in each group. Whichever group has less crabs will be removed. For example two groups of crabs cover eight spaces on the game board. One group has ten crabs and the other group has twelve crabs. The group with ten crabs will be eliminated.

If the tie has still not been decided, the current player gets to decide which group of crabs will get eliminated.

### Elimination And End Of Game

If a player is no longer able to legally move any of their crabs at the beginning of their turn, they are eliminated from the game. Once a player is eliminated they no longer take their turn. Any of the player’s crabs still on the game board stay in position until the end of the game or until they are washed off the game board.

The game continues until only one player is able to move at the beginning of their turn. This player wins the game.

If the game reaches a point where the remaining players keep repeating the same moves, the game ends in a draw and another game will need to be played in order to determine the winner.
